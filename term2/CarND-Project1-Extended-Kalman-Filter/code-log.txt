need to prepare init function to recive the first measurements
- created function in tools.cpp to help covert polar to cartesian coordinates
- use this fucntion in FusionEKF.ProcessMeasurement in the Initialization section, if received data is from Radar.
- set that as x
- init P "Covariance Matrix" , with initial values
- then out side the ( if Initialized ) section, set delta time,
- also update F matrix with delta time
- implement update and predict function in KalmanFilter class
- back to FusionEKF class, use the KalmanFilter.update if Laser
- // TODO : use Jacobian and KalmanFilter.UpdateEKF if RADAR
